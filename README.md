# ‚õ± Holiday Plans

This project consists of a RESTful API for managing vacation plans and these are some features:

1. User registration, login and logout;
2. Listing, registering, editing and deleting vacation plans;
3. Issuing a PDF report with details of a particular vacation plan;
7. Authentication for handling vacation plans and users;

The folder in the directory contains the project developed in Laravel.

## üíª Project setup

### üõ´ Initialization

To get started, we first need to initialize the Docker containers by running the following commands in the project root:

```
sudo make run
```

Once the containers are started, the Adminer for managing the database can be accessed via the URL http://localhost:8080.

With the initialization of the project, we already have the popularization of the bank through Factories and Seeders.

All set! It will be possible to make requests using the defined routes.
